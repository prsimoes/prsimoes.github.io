After finishing the Offensive Security PWK course labs, I decided to take a break and wait for a while before taking the certification exam. This was because, first, I needed some rest, and second, I wanted to have more time to prepare the labs report and generate a good template report for the exam. 

I learned so much during the PWK labs, that during this break, I decided to put my hands on some of the vulnerable machine challenges out there. I'm using the website [Vulnerable by Design][vulnhub] and after reading some stuff on the web, the De-ICE series, Kioptrix, Holynix and Tr0ll seem to be good targets. These are all "boot2root" vulnerable VMs.

I thought to myself that these VMs should be pretty simple, after the experience I had with the PWK labs. It happens that I was wrong and I actually learned new things that could be helpful on the OSCP exam. I'll be posting my walkthroughs of these challenges.
